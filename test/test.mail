# Markdown in email

The idea is to compose email messages in markdown, and deliver
multipart/alternative messages with html generated by pandoc and the plain-text
part is just the markdown. Advantages:

1. We get to compose messages in Vim
2. Recipients with email clients that dipslay html get a nicely formatted
message, and recipients using text interfaces get nicely readable markdown

This is also an effective way of sharing code via email:

```
some_function(arg1, arg2):
	tmpvalue = do_something(arg1, arg2)
	if (some_condition(tmpvalue)):
		x = y
	else:
		x = z
	return(x)
```

# Built-in previewer

If composing messages in the terminal to be read in rich css-ified viewers, it
would be nice to preview messages from time to time. So `mailpreview`.
